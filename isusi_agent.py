"""
ISUSI — AI Agent Backend
=========================

Built on Yaala Labs' Agent Kernel (https://github.com/yaalalabs/agent-kernel,
PyPI: `agentkernel`), running the OpenAI Agents SDK with Groq's Llama 3.3 70B
plugged in as the model (via Groq's OpenAI-compatible endpoint). Groq's free
tier has a much higher requests-per-minute limit than most alternatives,
which matters a lot for interactive testing/demoing.

Four agents, wired exactly the way Agent Kernel expects:
  - triage           routes the request to the right specialist (OpenAI SDK handoff)
  - fd_advisor        RENEW / HOLD / WITHDRAW advice per FD
  - health_scorer      scores the portfolio A-F across 5 dimensions
  - legacy_guardian    decides whether to check in on / alert the beneficiary

Each specialist is a plain `agents.Agent` with a small tool (a plain Python
function decorated with the OpenAI Agents SDK's `@function_tool`) that
computes exact numbers — maturity dates, amounts, portfolio stats — so the
LLM only has to reason over already-correct data, never do the arithmetic
itself.

Agent Kernel's `OpenAIModule` registers the agents with the Runtime, and
`RESTAPI.run()` exposes them over HTTP with zero extra code. The real,
installed endpoints (confirmed via the auto-generated docs at
http://localhost:8000/docs — the actual package's routes differ from what
the hosted docs site describes) are:
  POST /run                {"agent": "fd_advisor", "prompt": "...", "session_id": "..."}
                            → returns the agent's raw text response as a
                              plain JSON string (NOT wrapped in an object)
  GET  /agents
  GET  /health

This same server also serves the frontend (index.html) from a same-origin
custom route at GET /custom/app, so the browser never blocks the AI Agents
tab's requests as cross-origin.

Setup:
    pip install "agentkernel[openai,api]"
    export GROQ_API_KEY="..."
    python isusi_agent.py
